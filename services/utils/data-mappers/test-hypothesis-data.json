There are only a handful of successful MMORPGs (World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV, The Elder Scrolls Online, among others), and their fanbases have been playing some of them for years and years. It’s a notoriously tricky genre to break into. And it’s a reminder, too, of the strange alchemy required to make that rarest of things—a title that earns not only billions of dollars but also the allegiance of millions of discerning players. As one former Amazon employee told me, “There is some magic in making games. It’s not a science. No matter how big your pockets are, unless you’re building games because you want to build games, you’re not going to have success.”",

The calculation, according to two sources familiar with the deal, was that Amazon could leverage Twitch both to sell other publishers’ games and advertise its own. It could also hype up Prime subscriptions through the service. And it would gain access to a mother lode of data about what players and viewers liked best about particular games—what kept them coming back (and spending money) again and again.",

For a gargantuan $970 million, it bought up Twitch, now the most popular game-streaming service, with more than 50 million hours watched daily. The calculation, according to two sources familiar with the deal, was that Amazon could leverage Twitch both to sell other publishers’ games and advertise its own. It could also hype up Prime subscriptions through the service. And it would gain access to a mother lode of data about what players and viewers liked best about particular games—what kept them coming back (and spending money) again and again.",
